# Pebble
> A calm, behavior-aware AI learning companion that adapts to how you learn.

## Overview
Traditional learning systems evaluate correctness—right or wrong, pass or fail. This binary approach ignores the learning process itself, reacting only after failure has occurred.

Pebble is a behavior-aware learning companion that detects early struggle signals through interaction patterns—hesitation, focus shifts, and navigation choices—rather than just answer correctness. It provides optional, non-intrusive AI assistance that respects your flow, offering help only when you need it and only if you choose to accept it.

## Why Pebble
Most platforms focus on *what* you answer. Pebble focuses on *how* you learn.
By adopting calm computing principles, Pebble shifts the paradigm from "correction" to "support." It avoids constant interruptions and gamified pressure, giving you full control over when and how you receive guidance.

## Key Concepts
- **Behavioral Signal Observation**: Captures interaction events (clicks, hesitation, navigation) to understand learning flow.
- **Struggle Detection**: Uses heuristics to identify cognitive overload or confusion in real-time.
- **Context-Aware AI Nudges**: Generates helpful, optional hints relevant to the specific problem and user state.
- **Privacy-First Design**: Tracks behavior, not content. No screen recording or keylogging; users own their data.

## Repository Structure
- `requirements.md`: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements, identifying core problems and user needs.
- `design.md`: System architecture, component design, and data flow specifications for the solution.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its goals.

## How This Was Built
This project follows **Kiro’s Spec → Design flow**.
1.  **Idea**: Started with a natural language concept for a behavior-aware learning companion.
2.  **Requirements**: Generated a comprehensive requirements document to define the problem space.
3.  **Design**: Derived a system design and architecture directly from those requirements.
4.  **Artefacts**: Exported and committed these specifications as the foundation for the project.

## Hackathon Submission Details
- **Track**: [Student Track] AI for Learning & Developer Productivity
- **Scope**: This repository contains **design and requirements artefacts** for hackathon submission. It represents the specification and system design phase, not the full implementation code.

## Status
> This repository contains design and requirements artefacts for hackathon submission.
